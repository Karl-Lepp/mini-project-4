# Mini-project IV

### [Assignment](assignment.md)

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to implement and delpoy a model to a cloud that can be called upon.  The model is used to predict whether someones loan will be approved.

## Hypothesis
I believe that the total income will be the main factor in determining whether or not a loan is approved.

## EDA 
(fill in what you discovered in your exploration of the dataset)


## Process
### Step 1
Exploring the initial data I plotted several graphs that showed a rough linear relationship between Income and the amount of the loan.
### Step 2

## Results/Demo
The model performed well with little over 

## Challanges 
The biggest Challenge for this project was setting up the pipeline.

## Future Goals
The biggest issue I see with the model is the lack of training data that we can use, only having ~600 points to train it
